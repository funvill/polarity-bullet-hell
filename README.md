# Polarity bullet hell

This is an experment to see what kind of game I am build using Claude Sonnet 4.5 using 10 or less prompts (<=$1 in Tokens). The prompts are stored in the docs folder 00-04.

The primary polarity mechanic is inspired by [Ikaruga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikaruga) (2001) on the [Gamecube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCube).

Full source code is provided.
